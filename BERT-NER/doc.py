LEMTRADA = """ 
Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features to slow the accumulation of physical disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. The recommended dose of Lemtrada is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion for two treatment courses. Lemtrada is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to CD52, an antigen present at high levels on the surface of T and B lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The mechanism by which Lemtrada exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not fully elucidated. However, research suggests immunomodulatory effects through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes, including: Alterations in the number, proportions and properties of some lymphocyte subsets post-treatment. Increased representation of regulatory T cell subsets. Increased representation of memory T and B lymphocytes. Transient effects on components of innate immunity (i.e. neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells). The reduction in the level of circulating B and T cells by Lemtrada and subsequent repopulation may account for the therapeutic effect. Lemtrada is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) for patients with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features to slow the accumulation of physical disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. Active disease can be defined through the use of clinical or imaging features. In the phase III clinical trial program, active disease was defined as a patient with MS who has experienced at least 2 clinical episodes during the prior 2 years. Lemtrada is not recommended for patients with inactive disease or who are stable on current therapy. There is a limited amount of data from the use of Lemtrada in pregnant women. Lemtrada should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. It is unknown whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Therefore, breast feeding should be discontinued during each course of treatment with LEMTRADA and for 4 months following the last infusion of each treatment course. However, benefits of conferred immunity through breast-milk may outweigh the risks of potential exposure to alemtuzumab for the breastfed child. There is limited experience of the use of Lemtrada with or following immunosuppressive agents. As with other immunomodulating therapies, potential combined effects on the patient’s immune system should be taken into account when considering administration of Lemtrada. Concomitant use of Lemtrada with any of these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. Treatment with Lemtrada may result in the formation of antibodies and increase the risk of autoimmune mediated conditions including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, thyroid disorders or, rarely, nephropathies including anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Autoimmune events may occur many years after treatment. These events may be serious or life-threatening. It is not known whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk. Because immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, caution should be exercised when alemtuzumab is administered to a nursing woman. Breast feeding should be discontinued during each course of treatment with alemtuzumab and for 4 months following the last infusion of each treatment course. Alemtuzumab was detected in the milk and offspring of lactating female transgenic mice administered intravenous alemtuzumab 10 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days postpartum. There was evidence for reductions in lymphocytic counts, along with a reduced IgM antibody response in offspring at about 9 weeks postpartum following this treatment; a no-effect dose was not determined. Cognitive, physical, and sexual development of pups exposed to alemtuzumab during lactation were not affected. The relevance to humans of reproductive toxicity findings in transgenic mice is unknown.

BLOODWATCH = """
Bloodwatch is an automated risk management tool for patients that have been given Lemtrada for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It is designed to provide an additional layer of support for patient safety monitoring in order to improve outcomes for patients. Lemtrada has an approved risk management program including a recommendation for monthly pathology monitoring. The Bloodwatch program is designed to assist the monthly monitoring program by scheduling the tests, reminding patients of uncompleted tests, and if necessary, alerting the treating neurologist and team if particular results are abnormal. Bloodwatch is not intended to replace normal clinical care nor review of the pathology results.  Patients should have a monthly blood and urine testing for 48 months after their last infusion of Lemtrada. The tests performed are a monthly full blood count (FBC), electrolytes urea creatinine (EUC), urine microscopy, urine albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), and a quarterly thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Bloodwatch evaluates and alerts only the changes in analytes associated with identified autoimmune risks of Lemtrada: abnormally low neutrophils, haemoglobin, or platelet count; abnormally high creatinine, urine red blood cells, or urine albumin:creatinine ratio; and a low or high thyroid stimulating hormone. Bloodwatch will provide the neurologist with pre-completed pathology request forms as an electronic document that can be printed at any time from the practice portal. These forms should be signed by the neurologist and provided to the patient.  The Bloodwatch system is only for the standard monitoring tests. If your patient requires additional tests, please use a standard pathology request form – these can be collected at the same time. These results will not be monitored or paid for by Bloodwatch.  Bloodwatch does not replace your normal monitoring procedures. Rather, Bloodwatch improves patient safety by detecting and alerting abnormal pathology results for identified risks of Lemtrada, thereby providing an additional layer of defence. Bloodwatch does not analyse the full pathology set. Irrespective of the Bloodwatch Service, the prescribing Neurologist remains responsible for the pathology monitoring and risk management program following the use of Lemtrada. For more information, please refer to the Bloodwatch Terms of Use. The pathology test set for the identified risks in Lemtrada monitoring and the Bloodwatch service are provided by Bloodwatch free of charge to patients and their health care professionals. The Bloodwatch service is provided by RxMx Australia and Sanofi Australia pays for the service to be provided. Patients will not be using their Medicare card for these tests. Patients and healthcare professionals must make their own arrangements regarding other tests.  RiskMx does not recommend completely disabling SMS messages for the most important alerts. Your alert level preferences can be configured in the Practice Portal. Vacation dates can be entered into the practice portal. By enabling out of office you will not receive SMS alerts, however you will still receive alerts via email and your mobile app. Your delegate will continue to receive all alerts as usual. Email alerts will not be altered during vacation periods.
